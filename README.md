# Sunbird inQuiry

Sunbird inQuiry is a building block that enables question banks that can contain questions and question sets for various use cases such as practice, assessment, quiz, worksheet, survey, observations and many more.

### Description <a href="description" id="description"></a>

This building block consists of tools(editor and player) and services that enable **creation** of** **question(s) and question set(s), **configuration **of** **their behaviour, **curation** and **publishing **them for consumption, **playing** of question set(s) and **emission** of meaningful data.

inQuiry works with primarily two objects - Question and Question Set as per QuML Specification.

inQuiry can be extended for adaptive tests, gamified quizzes, rubric-driven assessments, competitions, data collection and other use-cases. It supports configurable behaviour of various kinds such as timer, certificate, hints, attempts, etc.

### Key capabilities: <a href="overview-of-capabilities" id="overview-of-capabilities"></a>

1. **Creation:** of question(s) and question set(s) as per an interoperable QuML spec either using the question set editor or by bulk upload.
2. **Configuration**: of the question set behaviour. For ex., randomize the questions from the question bank, limit the number of attempts, set timer etc.
3. **Tagging**: of question(s) and question set(s) with meaningful metadata useful for discovery and analysis.
4. **Publish: **Curation and publishing of question(s) and question set(s).
5. **Play**: The player for question set(s) is embeddable, configurable and extendable.
6. **Data Emission**:
   1. Emission of question response and result data using an interoperable specification (QuML)
   2. Emission of question set result and summary data using an interoperable specification (QuML)
   3. The editor and player emit useful telemetry to make meaning of the user's action, which can be used to generate reports and derive insights.
