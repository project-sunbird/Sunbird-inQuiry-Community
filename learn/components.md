### Question and question set service

Question and Question Set Service is a micro-service to manage the lifecycle and workflows of creation and consumption of question & question set objects.&#x20;

We use assessment APIs from Sunbird Knowlg for this purpose. (It will be decoupled and moved as part of inQuiry.)
