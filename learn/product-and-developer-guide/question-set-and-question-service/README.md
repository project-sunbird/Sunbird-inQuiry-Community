# Question Set & Question Service

Question and Question set service is a micro-service which provides APIs to manage the lifecycle and workflows of creation and consumption of question & question set objects.

We use assessment APIs from Sunbird Knowlg for this purpose. (It will be decoupled and moved as part of inQuiry.)

#### Key Features:

1. Enable APIs to manage the lifecycle of QuestionSet
2. Generate ECAR file on publishing QuestionSet for offline consumption asynchronously
